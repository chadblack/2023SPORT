The Rhetorical Précis is a formula designed to help you move beyond simple summary to a more analytical synopsis of a work. As such, the précis, in a compact form, forces you to think about both the content and method of a piece of scholarship. This is very useful in developing an historiographical understanding of the work you are reading, of the connections between works. The formula for the précis is based on a few simple sentences:  

1. Sentence one gives the following information:
	- name of the author, title of the work, date in parenthesis;
	- an intentionally chosen active verb (argues, asserts, claims, denies, refutes, proves, disproves, explains, etc.);
	- a that clause containing the major claim (thesis) of the work.
2. Sentence two gives an explanation of how the author develops and supports the major claim of the work identified in the first sentence.
3. Sentence three states the author’s apparent purpose, followed by an “in order to” phrase.

Formula:

> In Chapter 1 of *One Dimensional Man* (1964), Herbert Marcuse argues that [...]. To build this argument, Marcuse [...]. Marcuse makes this argument in order to [...].
